                  <p>
                    LinkedIn is a social networking site specifically created
                    for the business community. The purpose of the website is to
                    enable signed-up users to establish and maintain
                    professional networks of people they know and trust. You can
                    establish your professional brand on LinkedIn, highlight
                    your accomplishments and skills, Linkedin network with other
                    professionals, share content, and connect with coworkers,
                    business partners, and potential employers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    People can find your public profile in a variety of ways.
                    They might be trying to find employees for your company or
                    in your industry, remembering you from a conference and
                    wanting to review your accomplishments, or they might just
                    be interested in learning more about you. There is one
                    common and straightforward objective, though, regardless of
                    how or why they ended up on your LinkedIn page: Your
                    LinkedIn profile needs to grab and hold their attention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So what distinguishes a profile? How can you obtain more
                    referrals? What traits can you use to make your profile
                    stand out? You can create the ideal LinkedIn profile with
                    the help of our definitive guides.
                  </p>
                  <h2>How to write a great LinkedIn profile: The Essentials</h2>
                  <h3>1. Upload a great profile picture</h3>
                  <p>
                    As visual beings, your LinkedIn profile picture acts as your
                    business card, introducing you to others and influencing
                    their first impressions of you. Your profile picture should
                    be current, represent you, and have your face occupying
                    roughly 60% of the frame. The idea is to appear as
                    professional as possible so that potential contacts who may
                    have only met you virtually can more easily recognize you
                    from your profile photo.
                  </p>
                  <h3>2. Add a background photo</h3>
                  <p>
                    A background image that is a little bit bigger than your
                    profile photo and reveals a little bit more about who you
                    are can also be uploaded. Here, having you (or your face) in
                    the photo is less important, but you still want to come up
                    with something memorable that tells visitors more about you.
                    Your background image serves as the profile page's second
                    visual element. It gets people's attention, sets the scene,
                    and reveals a little bit more about your priorities. The
                    right background image is the single most important factor
                    in making your page stand out, draw attention, and remain
                    memorable.
                  </p>
                  <h3>3. Add your pronouns</h3>
                  <p>
                    By including pronouns up front, you can prevent any
                    awkwardness later. Pronouns are an essential part of the
                    ecosystem of both remote and face-to-face work. No matter
                    which pronouns best describe you—she/her, he/him, they/them,
                    or another combination—it is always a good idea to include
                    them on your LinkedIn profile.
                  </p>
                  <h3>4. Create a great headline</h3>
                  <p>
                    Your headline may have a greater impact on your profile.
                    Even though this concise justification for a job title is
                    frequently used, you can go a step further by describing
                    your current role in more detail, what it means to you, or
                    what you've accomplished. Explain your viewpoint on your
                    job, the driving forces behind your behavior, and what makes
                    you tick in the headline field.
                  </p>
                  <h3>5. Tell your story</h3>
                  <p>
                    Your LinkedIn summary gives you the freedom to tell your
                    story however you want. While some professionals only use it
                    to list their most recent positions held or most marketable
                    skills, it also has the potential to be a way to connect
                    with potential employers and colleagues by having relevant
                    content and revealing more about who you are and how you
                    came to land your current position.
                  </p>
                  <h3>6. Cut the buzzwords</h3>
                  <p>
                    Although common on LinkedIn, these kinds of self-promotional
                    sentences are ultimately uninspiring. They are buzzword- and
                    jargon-filled and offer no real insight into your
                    accomplishments or connections in the professional world;
                    rather, they are a generic repetition of phrases recruiters
                    have heard countless times.Be specific and clear when
                    describing your achievements.
                  </p>
                  <h3>7. List your relevant skills</h3>
                  <p>
                    Looking through the list of skills and choosing the ones
                    that apply to you is one of the simplest quick wins on
                    LinkedIn. By doing this, you give others a place to support
                    you and support the description in your Headline and
                    Summary. It is more effective to list the skills in a
                    linkedin profile that you usually insert in your cover
                    letter. The most crucial thing, however, is to stay up to
                    date. It can be burdensome to have a long list of skills
                    that aren't really necessary for who you are and what you
                    do.
                  </p>
                  <h3>8. Sync your profile</h3>
                  <p>
                    It's also worthwhile to sync your profile with your email
                    address book, but if you're using your company's provided
                    email address, make sure you have permission first. With
                    this email information at hand, LinkedIn can suggest
                    connections who may have common interests with you or who
                    might vouch for your abilities, and you decide who gets
                    contacted because you have complete control over all
                    connections.
                  </p>
                  <h3>9. Spotlight the services you offer</h3>
                  <p>
                    It's now simpler for consultants, freelancers, and staff
                    members of smaller businesses to highlight the range of
                    services they offer thanks to a new LinkedIn feature called
                    services. Your ability to be found in search results can be
                    improved by filling out the Services section of your
                    profile.
                  </p>
                  <h3>10. Share relevant content</h3>
                  <p>
                    In relation to relevance, profiles don't exist alone. As a
                    result, it's valuable to share pertinent content on your
                    profile page, such as thought leadership posts you've
                    written yourself or those from key figures in your industry.
                    Potential connections are more likely to reconnect if they
                    find and read engaging content in your profile.
                  </p>
                  <h3>11. Take a skills assessment</h3>
                  <p>
                    An online test called a skills assessment gives you the
                    chance to show off your proficiency level and display the
                    Verified Skills badge on your profile. Data indicates that
                    applicants with verified skills are about 30% more likely to
                    be hired for the positions they apply for; additionally,
                    providing evidence of your skills improves your personal
                    brand more broadly. You are under no obligation to share the
                    results of your skills assessments, and you are free to
                    retake them as many times as necessary before declaring
                    success.
                  </p>
                  <h3>12. Keep your location updated</h3>
                  <p>
                    Location is important when recruiters are looking for new
                    talent; by including your location, you help companies
                    narrow their search results more quickly and increase your
                    likelihood of hearing from them. It will also be simpler for
                    contacts and employers to find you if you update your
                    location.
                  </p>
                  <h3>13. Update your contact info</h3>
                  <p>
                    You might lose out on opportunities if your contact
                    information is out-of-date. Others prefer emails or phone
                    calls, while some recruiters and connections will use the
                    built-in LinkedIn messaging platform. By keeping your
                    current contact info up-to-date, you increase your chances
                    of connecting.
                  </p>
                  <h3>14. Follow your interests</h3>
                  <p>
                    There is something on LinkedIn for just about everyone
                    because it serves a huge variety of professionals with a
                    wide range of interests. It's worthwhile to find and follow
                    people who have similar interests to you in order to make
                    sure that you are actively using the platform as a whole and
                    connecting with the right people for your professional and
                    brand goals. Developing a wide range of interests can
                    enhance the impact of your profile, even if they are not
                    directly related to your current or future job roles.

                  <h3>15. Go public</h3>
                  <p>
                    You must make your profile public if you want connections to
                    find you and employers to find you. It's a simple procedure.
                    Go to your LinkedIn profile page and select "View Profile"
                    from the drop-down menu that appears when you click "Me"
                    under your profile picture at the top of the page. You'll
                    now have the option to edit your public profile and URL; by
                    choosing this option, you can decide whether your profile is
                    visible to the public and who can view your profile picture.
                  </p>
                  <h3>16. Stay connected</h3>
                  <p>
                    Once your profile is live, you should stay in touch. Spend
                    at least 15 minutes each week checking in to see what you
                    missed, commenting on pertinent stories, and responding to
                    messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You have options when it comes to perfecting your LinkedIn
                    profile, ranging from easy steps like making sure you've
                    uploaded a great picture to more involved tasks like writing
                    an engaging headline and bio. What is the perfect LinkedIn
                    profile? It's one that makes you stand out for all the right
                    reasons and enables you to accomplish your objectives,
                    whether they involve increasing your network, making new
                    contacts, or receiving a job offer. So, to have a good
                    linkedin profile is absolutely mandatory.
