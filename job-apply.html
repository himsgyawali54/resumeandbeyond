                  <h3><strong>What Is a Job Application?</strong></h3>
                  <p> A job application is an official document that businesses need all job seekers to complete. You can apply for a job through 
                     a third-party job listing site or by going to the possible employer's website. Some companies may need you to complete a paper 
                     application.<br><br> Employers utilize job applications because they give a uniform structure with the same questions that any person 
                     applying for an available position must answer. Employers can quickly compare each applicant's history and job experience.

                  <h3><strong>When to fill out a job application form</strong></h3>
                  <p> To apply for jobs, job searchers utilize job application forms in conjunction with their resumes.
                     Whether or not fresh employment are available, many firms keep their application forms public. 
                     They're usually assessing broad interest in these instances, and keeping select names on file 
                     for future jobs.<br><br> Applying for a new job may be a stressful experience because there are 
                     so many opportunities. Fill out application forms solely for jobs that match your goals and skill
                     sets for the best outcomes. Look into the company's history, motives, and pay rates, among other
                     things. If the organization fits all of your criteria, go ahead and fill out the form.

               <h2><strong>Different Kinds of Job Applications:</strong></h2>
               <p> These sorts differ according on the job or business. In addition to a résumé and cover letter,
                  candidates may be required to provide the following documents: 
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Online application</strong><br>
                     On their websites, many employers provide an online application. While some businesses offer basic 
                     applications, larger businesses have constructed massive databases to store applicant data and different
                     application forms.
                  </li>
                  <li class="pt-2"><strong>Email application</strong><br>
                     Some firms prefer email applications, which are especially handy for remote jobs. Applicants respond to questions,
                     take exams, and fill out minor forms along an email chain. This method is a cross between an application and an interview.
                  </li>
                  <li class="pt-2"><strong>Physical paper application</strong><br>
                     Physical paper applications are still used by certain firms, despite the fact that they are antiquated and insecure.
                     They're either available online as printed materials or distributed by facility staff. This allows individuals to 
                     apply in person and meet with a manager as soon as possible.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
               <h2><strong> What should a Job Application form contain?</strong></h2>
               <p> A sequence of questions on job application forms introduces candidates about the company. Sections are often used:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong> Contact info:</strong><br>
                     Applicants should fill out the first part with their full name, address, and contact information. City, state, street address,
                     zip code, and phone number are frequently requested.
                  </li>
                  <li class="pt-2"><strong>Employment history:</strong><br>
                     A section about employment history will also be included. It enables candidates to provide company names and contact information, 
                     as well as positions held and responsibilities performed. Businesses arrange this area in a variety of ways, especially online.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Availability:</strong><br>
                     The availability and commencement dates are generally listed in the next section. This part, like the employment history section, 
                     can take many different forms. Prepare to mention specific start and end hours for each weekday you are available.
                  </li>
                  <li class="pt-2"><strong>References:</strong><br>
                     A reference list is frequently included in the concluding part. Many companies ask for a set number of references, so have three
                     to five people ready with their contact information.
                  </li>
                  <li class="pt-2"><strong>Additional information</strong><br>
                     A disclaimer section or a brief review of terms and conditions can be found on many online and physical forms. Job searchers may 
                     need to certify that they read and accept the terms before completing the application.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>

               <h2><strong>How Job Applications Work</strong></h2>
               <p> A job application is a series of questions that demand factual
                  replies, unlike a resume and cover letter, which are prepared and 
                  formatted to showcase your most significant and outstanding qualifications.
                  You'll usually be required to include the following items:
               <ul>
                  <li>Information about yourself (name, address, email address, and phone number)</li>
                  <li>Employment dates</li>
                  <li>Held positions</li>
                  <li>Supervisors' names and contact information</li>
                  <li>Degree dates and subject areas</li>
                  <li>Where did you get your degree? (if applicable)</li>
