                  <h3><strong>Job Interview Preparation</strong></h3>
                  <P>preparing for your job interview is a one step closer to grabbing the position that you are aiming for. 
                     A lot goes behind a decent interview let alone an exceptional one. A good job interview preparation demands 
                     a good research and thorough consideration about whether you are the good fit for the position. Carefully going
                     through the history of company and detail study of the job description is highly important.

               <div class="col md-12">
                  <h3><strong>Here's few points to remember before your next interview:</strong></h3>
                  <ul>
                     <li><strong>Going through the job description thoroughly: </strong><br>
                        You should ask yourself why you want the job and if you are really fit for the position.
                        And when that ends up positive than you are good to go. When you are convinced, you want
                        the job and you are good enough, only task that’s left is a little prep. When you have the
                        idea, you will be able to express your interest in the opportunity and why you are the
                        best candidate for the job.
                        <br>Also, the job description tells the qualities and qualification
                        the employer is looking for. This gives you idea about what the potential questions the 
                        employer might ask and how you would answer them. You can align your thought and come out
                        as someone qualified for the job. 
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li><strong>Research on the company:</strong><br>
                        Research on the company not only helps you feel confident in the interview table, but it also 
                        helps you know if you can belong to such working environment. During the interview you can ask about 
                        the product and bring up the context related to the company, which will give the recruiter idea about 
                        you being keen on the opportunity. Modern companies these days tend to have Facebook, online blogs and 
                        other social media profiles. Reading through those post can give a general idea about the culture and 
                        values of the company. It is always a plus point knowing what you are aiming for. 
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Preparing for those common interview questions:</strong><br>
                        There are some common interview questions asked no matter what company you are interviewing for or what 
                        position you are aiming for. Some common interview questions are mentioned below:
                        <ol>
                           <li class="pt-1">Why should we hire you? / what your strength?/ tell us some of your five good qualities?<br>
                              Above mentioned questions are one of the most asked one but in different pattern. In one way or the other 
                              they are trying to know how you are better than other candidates and what are those qualities that makes you 
                              the best choice for the job. <br>
                              Example: I was always looking forward to work for the company with not just good marketing strategies but great values.
                              Also, ideologies of this company aligns with my work ethics and I don’t think I could find a better opportunity than this.
                           </li>
                           <li class="pt-1">Why did you apply for this role?<br>
                              This question is generally asked to check your understanding of the responsibility that comes along with the role. 
                              It is a good opportunity to share your skills that fits the role.<br>
                              Example: i was always passionate about being a fashion designer and especially to be a part of such big fashion house 
                              is dream come true. Being associated with a fashion house that is trying to touch peoples life by fund raising is rare.
                              I am someone who believes in helping people, and when it can be done through the work that I worship is unbelievable. 
                           </li>
                        </ol>
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li><strong>Why this company among others?</strong><br>
                        This question requires good research about the company. Having an idea about their background, product, culture, values is
                        mandatory. You can answer this question by mentioning what appeals to you the most and align it with the skills you have 
                        and how that makes you a good fit.<br>
                        Example: I joined medical field solely because I believed as humans, we are here to help one another. One thing that really 
                        pulled me to join this hospital was the monthly health camp conducted in the rural areas and free medicines distributed. 
                        I finally found the place that matched my values and I could not be more willingly to grab this opportunity.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li><strong>Work on your presentation:</strong><br>
                        Those first few minutes are crucial of your job interview. That’s the reason why, it is important to make a good impression
                        with a positive body language and good speaking tone. You should also be able to maintain a good eye contact throughout the
                        interview, it makes to look confident and can often be a deciding factor for you to either land the job or miss out.
