                  <p>
                    Are you applying for jobs online and are waiting for a
                    response? Your resume might need to be ATS-friendly. Many
                    companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to screen
                    resumes and narrow the candidate pool. This means your
                    resume needs to be optimized for ATS compatibility to
                    increase your chances of getting hired. In this guide, we
                    will go over some tips on how to check if your resume is
                    ATS-friendly and how to make the necessary adjustments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To determine if your resume is ATS (Applicant Tracking
                    System) friendly, compare it to an ATS-optimized example.
                    Pay attention to the following aspects:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Chronological format</li>
                    <li>Relevant keywords</li>
                    <li>Clear headings</li>
                    <li>Degrees and abbreviations</li>
                    <li>Career target</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h2>
                    What is Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and how does it
                    work?
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is a software tool many
                    companies and recruitment agencies use to manage their
                    recruitment process. ATS helps employers streamline and
                    automate hiring by screening and sorting job applications
                    based on specific criteria. This saves hiring managers
                    significant time and effort, especially when they receive
                    many applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ATS scans resumes and job applications for keywords and
                    phrases related to the job description and required
                    qualifications. It then ranks and filters the applications
                    based on the relevance of the keywords and phrases found in
                    each resume. If your resume has the necessary keywords, it
                    may pass the ATS screening process and never be seen by the
                    hiring manager. Contact us to know more information

                  </p>
                  <h4>So, why does ATS matter for job seekers?</h4>
                  <p>
                    With an estimated 75% of resumes being rejected by ATS
                    before they even reach a human recruiter, ensuring that your
                    resume is ATS-friendly is essential. To do this, job seekers
                    must understand how ATS works and optimize their resumes
                    using relevant keywords and a simple, straightforward format
                    with easy-to-read headings. By doing so, job seekers can
                    increase their chances of passing the ATS screening and
                    getting their resumes seen by hiring managers.

                  <h2>How to Make an ATS-Compliant Resume?</h2>
                  <h3>ATS-Compatible Resume Formatting</h3>
                  <p>
                    It's crucial to use a standard, easy-to-read format for your
                    resume to ensure it's ATS-friendly. Avoid using images,
                    charts, tables, and other visual elements that may confuse
                    an ATS. Stick to a traditional, reverse-chronological format
                    with straightforward headings. Hiring managers prefer this
                    format, and it's easy for ATS to process. On our website,
                    you can find resume templates designed for ATS compatibility
                    and tips on popular resume formats which also showcase about

                    and so on.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Keyword Optimization</h3>
                  <p>
                    Keyword Optimization for ATS One of the most critical
                    aspects of an ATS-friendly resume is optimizing it with
                    relevant keywords. Keywords refer to words that an ATS may
                    search for in a job application that match the job
                    description or industry. Your resume should already contain
                    core industry keywords, but reviewing the job description
                    for additional keywords to include is essential. A skills
                    section with relevant keywords can help you quickly swap
                    them in and out when applying for different positions.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Send Your Resume as a Word Document</h3>
                  <p>
                    Sending your resume as a Word document, specifically a .doc
                    or .docx file, ensures that it can be quickly processed by
                    all ATS systems and is preferred by most hiring managers.
                    Although some ATS systems now process PDFs, some may still
                    need help. It's not worth the risk of losing formatting, so
                    sending your resume as a Word .doc is best to guarantee that
                    it's ATS-friendly.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Spell Out Abbreviations</h3>
                  <p>
                    An ATS may not understand all abbreviations, so it's
                    essential to spell them out at least once. Additionally,
                    spelling out abbreviations helps recruiters and hiring
                    managers who may need to become more familiar with
                    industry-specific jargon. This ensures that everyone
                    reviewing your resume can easily understand what you do. For
                    example, spell "Certified Public Accountant" instead of
                    "CPA."
                  </p>
                  <h3>Include Relevant Information</h3>
                  <p>
                    The ATS scans your resume to determine if it contains
                    relevant information and experience for a particular job.
                    Tailoring your resume to the specific job and industry
                    you're applying for is crucial which can be the first step
                    for the preparation of your
                    <a href="job-apply">job application</a> process . Include
                    only relevant experience and education, highlighting
                    transferable skills if you have yet to gain direct
                    experience. Only submit a resume that contains relevant
                    information that may be clear to the ATS.
                  </p>

                  <h2>How to Test Your Resume for ATS-Compatibility?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Several online tools are available to test your resume's ATS
                    compatibility. They are:
                  </p>
                  <h3>Jobscan</h3>
                  <p>
                    To use Jobscan, copy and paste your resume and the job
                    description into the respective fields on the website.
                    Jobscan will then analyze your resume and provide a score
                    out of 100, along with feedback on how to improve your
                    resume's ATS compatibility.
                  </p>
                  <h3>RezRunner</h3>
                  <p>
                    Another tool to consider is RezRunner, which uses artificial
                    intelligence to scan your resume for keywords, formatting,
                    and other factors that affect ATS compatibility. Once the
                    scan is complete, you will receive a report with detailed
                    feedback and suggestions on optimizing your resume for ATS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When interpreting the results of an ATS test, pay attention
                    to the feedback and suggestions provided. Look for areas
                    where your resume could be improved, such as using more
                    relevant keywords or adjusting formatting. Remember that
                    optimizing your resume for ATS compatibility is just one
                    aspect of a successful job search, and it's essential to
                    tailor your resume and cover letter to each job you apply
                    for.

                    ATS-friendly resume test 1: Save your resume in plain text
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Saving a copy of your resume as plain text is a quick and
                    easy way to check if your resume is ATS-friendly. Applicant
                    tracking systems often need help to read embedded tables,
                    symbols, charts, images, and other design elements. If the
                    ATS software does not recognize these design elements
                    correctly, it may skip over important information in those

                    When saving your resume as plain text, check for missing
                    details, incorrect characters, and disorganized formatting.
                    Correct any issues before submitting your resume to ensure
                    the ATS software can adequately read and interpret it.

                  <h3>ATS-friendly resume test 2: Request a free ATS scan</h3>
                  <p>
                    As a professional resume writing service, we offer a free
                    resume review with an ATS resume scan. The review is divided
                    into two parts. In the first half, we objectively evaluate
                    your resume's content and design. In the second half, our
                    team analyzes what information an ATS will extract from your
                    resume, what it cannot identify and retrieve, and the top
                    skills and keywords your resume ranks for. If your resume
                    fails the ATS readability test, it may not reach hiring
                    managers or recruiters.

                  <h2>Why Do You Need an ATS-Friendly Resume?</h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Many companies use ATS (Applicant Tracking System) to
                      screen resumes and identify candidates who match the job
                      well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      ATS scan resumes for keywords, skills, and other relevant
                      information to identify qualified candidates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If your resume is not ATS-friendly, it may not be parsed
                      correctly by the system, leading to it being discarded or
                      overlooked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      An ATS-friendly resume increases your chances of being
                      selected for an interview as it can pass through the
                      system's initial screening process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It helps you stand out from other applicants and makes it
                      easier for hiring managers to see why you are a good fit
                      for the job.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      An ATS-friendly resume is easy to read, well-organized,
                      and tailored to the specific job you are applying for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It saves recruiters and hiring managers time and effort by
                      highlighting your qualifications and experience clearly
                      and concisely.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
