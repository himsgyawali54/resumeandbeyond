               <h3><strong>What is the concept of Statement of Purpose?</strong></h3>
               <p> The SOP is an essay cum application document that every student 
                  needs to write for enrollment in the international universities. You can even
                   call it an admission essay, letter of motivation or simply SOP.  It is a way 
                   through which one can introduce themselves, their qualities, experiences, 
                   career goal and passion towards the field. The main aim of the SOP is to 
                   come out through yours stories as the most deserving and meritorious candidate 
                   for the desired course.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
               <h3><strong>Why is SOP so important?</strong></h3>
               <p> In this competitive world everyone has some new ideas to bring to 
                  the table.it is quite a task to stand out among such large number of applicants 
                  with a stellar academic score. The admission panels are not in a position to 
                  understand the skill, interest pattern and the personality of the applicant 
                  solely from the academic results. However with a good statement of purpose, 
                  we are able to express our motivation, passion and career goals to them, making 
                  it convenient to look beyond just an academic score of an applicant.
               </p>
               <p>Unlike any other document this document is completely under your control 
                  and it acts as the platform to express who you are and why you should be the part of 
                  the program. Through SOP you can share your vision and stand out among thousands of 
                  applicants. Hence SOP acts as that key that will help you getting admission despite 
                  not having a stellar academic performance as they take those who are fit for the course.

                  <h2><strong>Why Do You Need A Professional SOP Writers?</strong></h2>
                  <h3>There Are Some Common Mistakes Made By Students That Professional Writers Don’t:</h3>
                  <ul style="text-align:justify ;">
                     <li>Starting the SOP with phrase I’ve graduated from xyz high school with a GPA of xyz. This is one way that is bound to fail. 
                        SOP is not a verbose form of application. it is showing how you are motivated and passionate about the course. Use this to tell
                        your story that is unlike anyone’s story. Introduce yourself who you are, your goals and why you want to be part of their system.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li>Don’t compare yourself to other candidates. Students tend to read sample SOP and believe that they are losers and there is 
                        nothing good to write down on the essay. Looking down upon oneself already reduces half of the chance of getting in the university. 
                        We on the other hand, pick out the best in you and quote it down in the SOP.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li>Pretending to be someone else is another major problem. We know about wanting to make an impression on the admission panel. 
                        And it’s normal for you to do so. But disregarding your failure doesn’t do any good. Everyone has flaws and failures. You are 
                        not supposed to be perfect. Students who learned and came out as a better person are looked upon and inspiring to many.
                        Many fail to beautifully show there failures and achievements. That’s when and why you need professional help.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li>Being too shy about mentioning ones achievement is another common mistakes made by students. We all believe that humility 
                        is surest sign of strength. But let’s ignore that while writing a statement of purpose we are basically selling our qualities.
                        So, it’s very important to put our best foot forward. And we help you do so. You are brand in yourself and we help you present 
                        yourself in the best way possible.
