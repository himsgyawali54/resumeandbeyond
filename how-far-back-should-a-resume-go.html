                  <p>
                    Due to the ever growing population in today’s generation,
                    job searching is more common than before. If you're not
                    receiving many job interview calls or responses to your job
                    applications, it might be because you've included every role
                    you've ever held since the beginning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To be honest, recruiters and hiring managers aren't
                    interested in seeing your whole employment history. Certain
                    factors must be considered while creating a professional
                    resume as it serves as the foundation for your job
                    application. The common practice to build a resume is to
                    keep work experience of 10 to 15 years in the experience
                    section. It can depend on a person’s work history and
                    experience. In general, if a position provides you with
                    useful experience and abilities that are relevant to your
                    employment aim, you should include it on your resume.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the end of this article you will have a proper knowledge
                    on how much valuable work experience is needed in a resume.
                  </p>
                  <h2>2. Entry Level Positions</h2>
                  <p>
                    This position mostly consists of students having low or
                    almost no experience in the relative field.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    How far back should a resume go when you don’t have any
                    experience?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    With no job titles under your belt, you can try listing out
                    the academic achievements and other achievements that you
                    have gained until now. If you are in college and have
                    engaged in any meaningful extracurricular activities, they
                    can also be added to your resume. For entry level positions,
                    consider highlighting any leadership responsibilities you’ve
                    held as well as the volunteer experiences that demonstrate
                    your creativity. Most hiring companies can tell when a
                    resume is full of filler.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Continuing educational classes can be added to a portion of
                    your resume devoted to special interests or hobbies, since
                    this reflects an ambitious commitment to enhancing your
                    technical abilities. The main focus should be on the post
                    graduation experience whether it be your part time job, full
                    time jobs, unpaid internships or volunteering. Proper
                    guidance is most significant and important during this
                    period which is why you should refer to our

                  <h2>2. Mid Level Positions</h2>
                  <p>
                    People in these positions usually apply at a mid level
                    vacancy having 2-5 years of experience.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    How far back should a resume go when you have mid level
                    experience?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    This is the time to filter out college experience. Now that
                    you have gained more experience, it is the time to start
                    presenting the history of your career experiences on your
                    professional resume. Make sure your cover letter and resume
                    format is relevant to the specific job or industry you are
                    seeking for each time you apply for a new job. At this stage
                    in your career, your resume should simply include your most
                    recent and relevant job experience following graduation.
                    That means excluding the academic projects, awards from your
                    resume.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to a job experience area you can include your
                    skills as this area helps demonstrate to your hiring manager
                    that you have the necessary skills and abilities for the
                    post. You can highlight a few key traits you have, such as
                    communication skills, adaptability, and dependability. Make
                    cautious not to overdo it and just mention those you are
                    passionate about. You can also add personal projects that
                    fit with your job possibility are a wonderful approach to
                    demonstrate to a hiring manager your devotion and internal
                    determination to succeed in your work.
                  </p>
                  <h2>3. Senior Level Positions</h2>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to senior positions, the recruiter often looks
                    for candidates having lots of professional experience.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    How far back should a resume go when you have 10-15 years of
                    experience?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    By the time you have been working for 10-15 years, it is
                    recommended to list out the work experiences from your
                    career histories depending on your job application. You can
                    use the job you are applying for as a guide to decide
                    whether to keep or discard a past job position on your
                    resume. When you have multiple job titles under your belt,
                    you may want to consider dividing your work experience into
                    two categories:
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Related Experience:</b></p>
                  <p>
                    Include the roles and responsibilities that are related to
                    your job target with proper details that highlight your
                    accomplishments.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Other Experience:</b></p>
                  <p>
                    You can list unrelated positions you had within the last
                    10-15 years without proper job description so that there are
                    no visible gaps on your CV format.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Assume you worked as a software developer for a software
                    company for four years. You were then given a position as
                    managing director at another company, where you worked for
                    the following eight years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this career change, you should definitely minimize
                    details of your four years as a software engineer in order
                    to include more information about your accomplishments as a
                    managing director while updating your CV. In this case, you
                    can also include you part time job if they are more relevant
                    to the job description. Hiring managers are more likely to
                    be interested in what you have accomplished in your most
                    recent position than where you worked more than 12 years
                    ago. Doing this will keep your experience clear and to the
                    point so that the recruiter doesn’t have to research for it
                    in a more extensive career history.
                  </p>
                  <h2>4. People Returning To Work After A Large Break</h2>
                  <p>
                    If you've taken a gap from your work that causes most or all
                    of your experience to fall outside of it - for example, to
                    raise children, recover from an accident or even taking care
                    of family - you'll need to go back a bit further on your
                    resume. This is OK, but you should explain why your most
                    recent job experience is so distant. This can be done in a
                    cover letter or at the top of the page in a resume summary.
                    <a href="cover-letter-writing">Cover Letter Writing</a> with
                    proper format can indefinitely increase your chances of
                    landing a job.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, you should consider how relevant your previous
                    experience is while deciding what to include and exclude.
                    And make sure to add everything you've done during that
                    time, whether it's part-time work, a side business, or
                    anything else to keep you current in your industry.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Mistakes To Avoid While Making Resume</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Do not add work experience that exceeds more than 15 years
                      in the resume formats.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Avoid listing all of the experiences you have ever had.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Don’t make your resume too long as your recruiter will not
                      be interested in reading a long list of details of your
                      work in the experience section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Avoid mentioning too many irrelevant experiences, since
                      this may make the recruiting manager believe you lack the

                  <h2>What Should You Include In Your Resume?</h2>
                  <p>
                    There are several sorts of resumes to examine. The length of
                    your resume is determined by your employment history and the
                    sort of job you are seeking for. Consider the industry, and
                    the role in the company that you are applying for. Examine
                    the job description to determine exactly what talents they
                    need if your experience fits, the next thing you should do
                    is to portray that experience in a way that demonstrates
                    your trustworthiness.

                    Overall, it is up to you to mention what comes naturally
                    while applying for a job or gaining new experience. Some
                    resumes, such as those in academia, are more descriptive and
                    may exceed more than two pages. For most jobs, it is
                    preferable to keep them as brief as possible. Most essential
                    of all, you should highlight the experiences on your resume
                    to show as the greatest candidate possible for that
                    position. It will make the job searching process a lot
                    quicker and efficient.
